# TokenWatch CLI - Implemented Improvements

This document outlines the improvements implemented to make the codebase more robust and production-ready.

## 1. ✅ Added .gitignore File
- Protects sensitive data (API keys, config files)
- Excludes build artifacts and temporary files
- Includes IDE-specific files and OS-specific files
- Location: `.gitignore`

## 2. ✅ Implemented Retry Logic and Rate Limiting
### Rate Limiting
- Created `pkg/utils/http_client.go` with `RateLimitedClient`
- Configurable requests per second with burst capacity
- Prevents hitting API rate limits
- Default: 1 request/second with burst of 5

### Retry Logic
- Exponential backoff retry mechanism
- Configurable max retries and backoff parameters
- Only retries on server errors (5xx) and network errors
- Default: 3 retries with exponential backoff

### Circuit Breaker
- Created `pkg/utils/circuit_breaker.go`
- Prevents cascading failures
- Opens after 5 consecutive failures
- Resets after 1 minute
- Three states: Closed, Open, Half-Open

## 3. ✅ Centralized Common Utilities
### Prompt Utilities
- Created `pkg/utils/prompt.go`
- Functions: `Prompt()`, `PromptMasked()`, `ConfirmPrompt()`, `MaskAPIKey()`
- Removed duplicate prompt functions from commands
- Consistent user interaction across the CLI

## 4. ✅ Implemented Structured Logging
### Logger Implementation
- Created `pkg/utils/logger.go`
- Log levels: Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal
- Structured log entries with timestamps and fields
- Color-coded output for terminal
- Global logger initialization in `main.go`
- Environment variable support: `TOKENWATCH_LOG_LEVEL`

### Usage
- Replaced `fmt.Printf` with structured logging in HTTP client
- Log levels respect config and environment settings
- Better debugging with structured fields

## 5. ✅ Added API Key Validation
### Validation Implementation
- Created `pkg/utils/validation.go`
- Platform-specific validation (currently OpenAI)
- Validates key format and permissions
- Tests API connectivity during setup
- Checks for required scopes (e.g., `api.usage.read` for OpenAI)

### Setup Integration
- Validates API key before saving
- Provides clear error messages for invalid keys
- Allows user to save unvalidated keys with warning
- Better user experience during setup

## 6. ✅ Improved Error Handling
### Structured Errors
- Created `pkg/utils/errors.go`
- Error types: Config, API, Auth, Network, RateLimit, Validation
- Actionable suggestions for each error type
- Context-aware error messages

### Error Types and Suggestions
- **Config Errors**: Suggest running setup, check file permissions
- **API Errors**: Status code specific suggestions
- **Auth Errors**: Platform-specific setup instructions
- **Network Errors**: Connection troubleshooting steps
- **Rate Limit Errors**: Automatic retry information

### Integration
- Updated providers to use structured errors
- Better error messages in commands
- Helpful suggestions for common issues

## 7. ✅ Additional Improvements
### Version Command
- Created `cmd/root/version_cmd.go`
- Shows version, build time, and platform support
- Clear indication of coming soon features

### Code Quality
- All code compiles successfully
- Proper dependency management
- Consistent error propagation
- Clean separation of concerns

## Usage Examples

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug logging
export TOKENWATCH_LOG_LEVEL=debug
./tokenwatch openai
```

### API Key Validation
```bash
# During setup, API keys are now validated
./tokenwatch setup
# Shows validation progress and errors with helpful suggestions
```

### Error Handling
```bash
# If API key is invalid, you'll see:
[AUTH] OpenAI not configured
Suggestions:
  1. Run 'tokenwatch setup' to configure your openai API key
  2. Verify your API key is correct and hasn't been revoked
  3. Check if you're using the right type of API key (e.g., Admin key for OpenAI)
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Resilience**: Retry logic and circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
2. **User Experience**: Clear error messages with actionable suggestions
3. **Debugging**: Structured logging makes troubleshooting easier
4. **Security**: API key validation prevents storing invalid credentials
5. **Performance**: Rate limiting prevents API throttling
6. **Maintainability**: Centralized utilities reduce code duplication

## Next Steps

1. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. Implement remaining platforms (Anthropic, Grok, Cursor)
3. Add metrics and monitoring capabilities
4. Create CI/CD pipeline
5. Add more sophisticated caching strategies
